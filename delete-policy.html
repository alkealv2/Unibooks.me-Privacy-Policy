    To delete your account, follow these steps:

  <li>  In the settings menu, select "Delete Account".</li>
  <li>  Before deleting your account, make sure to remove any active listings. If you have active listings, you must delete them first. Otherwise, your account cannot be deleted. If you have no active listings, your account and all associated data will be permanently removed immediately.</li>

            <p>Effective date: February 13, 2026</p>
            To keep my app clean and respect your data, I regularly delete inactive accounts.
            An acccount is considered inactive if there has been no login or other activity for three (3) continuois months.
            From the effective date above, any account that has been inactive for more than three (3) months may be permanently deleted, included all personal data stored in my systems. Once an account is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
            Thank you for trying out the app. it's been a fun experience creating it and sharing it with you!
